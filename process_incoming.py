prompt = f''' I have some cooking tutorials. Here are the video subtitle chunks containing video title, number, text at that time, the start time in seconds and end time in seconds timestamp of the chunk.

{new_df[['title', 'number','start', 'end', 'text']].to_json(orient='records')}
-----------------------------
"{incoming_query}"

User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer where and how much it is relevant to the question in a human way(and don't mention the above format it is just for you). Also provide the timestamp and the particular video in which the question is answered. If user asks any irrelevant question, tell them to ask relevant question related to the cooking tutorials.
